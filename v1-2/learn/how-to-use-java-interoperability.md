# How to call Java code from Ballerina

## Introduction
Ballerina offers a straightforward way to call the existing Java code from Ballerina and also provides a Java API to call Ballerina code from Java.  Although Ballerina is not designed to be a JVM language, the current implementation, which targets the JVM, aka jBallerina, provides Java interoperability by adhering to Ballerina language semantics. 

### Ballerina bindings to Java code
Your task is to write Ballerina code (Ballerina bindings) that lets you call into the corresponding Java API.

This guide teaches you how to manually write those bindings as well as how to generate those bindings automatically, but first, let's look at why you want to call Java from Ballerina. 

### Why you want to call Java from Ballerina 
- Ballerina is a relatively new language. Therefore, you may experience a shortage of libraries in [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/). In such situations, as a workaround, you can use an existing Java library.
- You are already familiar with a stable Java API that you would like to use in your Ballerina project. 
- You want to take advantage of the strengths of Ballerina, but you don’t want to reinvest in the libraries that you or your company have written already. 

There may be other reasons, but these are great motivations to use Ballerina bindings. 

### Writing Ballerina bindings
Manually writing Ballerina bindings is a tedious task. You’ll soon see why. Therefore, we’ve developed a tool called `bindgen` that can generate Ballerina bindings for given Java APIs. The first section of this guide shows you how to use it. The second section is a reference guide to the tool. 

The third section explains how to package Java libraries (JAR files) with Ballerina programs. This section is useful because whenever you generate bindings for a Java library, you need to package this Java library and its transitive dependencies to produce a self-contained executable program. 

The fourth and fifth sections explain how to write these bindings manually. It is also a useful section for those who want to understand the inner workings of calling Java from Ballerina and for those who want to customize the bindings generated by the `bindgen` tool.
