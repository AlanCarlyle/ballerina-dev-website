# How to call Java code from Ballerina

## Introduction
Ballerina offers a straightforward way to call the existing Java code from Ballerina and also offers a Java API to call Ballerina code from Java.  Although Ballerina is not designed to be a JVM language, the current implementation, which targets the JVM, aka jBallerina, provides Java interoperability by adhering to Ballerina language semantics. 

### Ballerina bindings to Java code
All you have to do here is write Ballerina code (Ballerina bindings) that lets you call into the corresponding Java API.

This guide teaches you how to manually write those bindings as well as how to automatically generate those bindings, but first let's look at why you want to call Java from Ballerina. 

### Why you want to call Java from Ballerina 
- Ballerina is a relatively new language and because of that sometimes you may find missing Ballerina libraries. In such situations, as a workaround you can use an existing Java library.
- You are already familiar with a stable Java API that you would like to use in your Ballerina project. 
- You want to take advantage of the strengths of Ballerina, but you don’t want to reinvest into the libraries that you or your company have written already. 

There may be other reasons, but these are great motivations to use Ballerina bindings. 

### Writing Ballerina bindings
Manually writing Ballerina bindings is a tedious task. You’ll soon see why. Therefore, we’ve developed a tool called `bindgen` that can generate Ballerina bindings given Java APIs. The first section of this guide provides an overview of this tool. The second section is a reference guide to the bindgen tool. 

The third section explains how to package Java libraries (JAR files) with Ballerina programs. This section is important because whenever you generate bindings for a Java library, you need to package this Java library and its transitive dependencies to produce a self-contained executable program. 

The fourth and fifth sections explain how to write these bindings manually. It is also an important section for those who want to understand the inner workings of calling Java from Ballerina and for those who want to customize the bindings generated by the `bindgen` tool.
