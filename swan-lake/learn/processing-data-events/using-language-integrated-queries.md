## Using Language-Integrated Queries

As of now, language-integrated queries are supported for iterator implementations such as an array, map, stream, and table. The two kinds of integrated queries below can be written in Ballerina.

- [Query Expressions](#query-expressions)
- [Query Actions](#query-actions)

## Query Expressions

Query expressions allow you to generate a list, table, string, or an XML. The sections below include the clauses you can use in a query expression.

### Query Clauses

Query expressions contain a set of clauses similar to SQL to process the data. They must start with the `from` clause and can perform various operations such as filter, join, sort, limit, and projection. There are various SQL-like clauses to perform these operations.

#### 'From' Clause

The `from` clause is used to define the input iterator source that is considered for processing the data. Similar to the `for each` statement, you can specify any iterator as the expression.
